## 🛒 Description Tech Store App
The **TechStore App** is a cutting-edge mobile e-commerce platform designed to offer a premium, modern shopping experience for technology and electronic gadgets. Developed entirely with Jetpack Compose, the project's core focus is on delivering a visually stunning and highly functional GUI that captures the sleek, high-tech nature of the products it features.

The project includes essential **Data Model Classes (e.g., Product, User, CartItem)** to formally define the application's data structure and incorporates a streamlined Compose Navigation system to ensure a smooth, intuitive user journey through all the screens.
